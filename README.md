## Project Presentation
Gas Finder is an application coded in Kotlin that helps users find points of sale that sell fuel. It uses geolocation data imported either from JSON or XML files.

## Team Presentation
Gas Finder was developed by a skilled team of five individuals:
- Bourjala Tom
- Le Gall Brandan
- Rastad Milena
- Caliendo Fran√ßois
- Der Krikorian William

## Project Requirements
The Gas Finder application was built according to the following requirements:
- Use of MVC Architecture
- Coding in Kotlin
- Use of JSON / XML data sources

## Tools
Our team developed Gas Finder using the following tools and technologies:
- Kotlin language program
- JSON and XML for handling data
- Swing for the user interface
- Multithreading for increased performance

## Architecture
The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, with each component serving specific purposes. It has two data sources and multithreading for enhanced performance.

## Task Distribution
The work of developing the application was evenly distributed among the five team members, who collaborated regularly to create a product that solves the problem efficiently and elegantly.

## Features
Gas Finder features include:
- Fuel station search 
- Interactive map
- Detailed view of a station
- Selection of stations
- Use of two data sources (JSON / XML)
- Multithreading for enhanced functionality

## Challenges and Improvements
We experienced some challenges during development, such as making the interactive map compatible with Kotlin and Swing. Furthermore, we had to deal with outdated documentation. In future iterations of the product, we plan to add a route calculation feature.
